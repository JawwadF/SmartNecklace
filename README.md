# SmartNecklace
IoT smart necklace which detects falls and injuries and alerts an assigned person

Using the BBC Microbit, the smart necklace will detect sharp changes in acceleration using the built in accelerometer. 

Copying things to the RPi:
scp SCPTest.txt pi@169.254.90.119:			(Places the file in the home directory)

Pairing mode for MicroBit:
Hold two buttons at the front, and then hold the reset at the back for one second (still holding two button at front). Should say pairing mode on the display
